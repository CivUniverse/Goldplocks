## Goldplocks

This is a simple plugin to add "gold block" elevators. The original idea was first implemented
by CivRealms, but is also present on CivUniverse.

Zero configuration required, just drop the JAR into your plugins folder and any gold block
instantly becomes an elevator.

Right click to go up, left click to go down.

Tested on 1.17.1, but should function on any 1.13+ server.
